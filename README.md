# MDN JavaScript Learning Excercises 📚
This repository contains my solutions and exercises from the JavaScript MDN Web Docs learning pathway.



## Introduction 👋
This repository serves as a personal learning journal for my progress through the JavaScript MDN Web Docs tutorials. It includes all the exercises I've completed. If someone stumbles upon this and wants to give me feedback, please you are more than welcome.

## Structure 📁
Folders 1-3 contain the first three lessons from [Learn web development - Scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting) from MDN which is an overview of what is JavaScript and what can it do. Folders 3-*6 contain lessons that go into the basics of JavaScript.

## Credits 🤝
Thanks to [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for putting an awesome guide completely for free.
